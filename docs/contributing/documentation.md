# Contributing documentation
One way to contribute to ``llmware`` is by contributing documentation.

There are two ways to contribute to the ``llmware`` documentation.
The first is via docstrings in the code, and the second is what you are currently reading.
In both areas, you can contribute in a lot of ways.
Here is a non exhaustive list of these ways.

1. Add documentation (e.g., adding a docstring to a function)
2. Update documentation (e.g., update a docstring that is not in sync with the code)
3. Simplify documentation (e.g., formulate a docstring more clearly)
4. Enhance documentation (e.g., add more examples to a docstring or fix typos)
